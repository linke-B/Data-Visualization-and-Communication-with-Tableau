1. Use the dognition_data_no_aggregation data set provided in this course for this quiz.
In the dognition_data_no_aggregation data set, the greatest drop offs of test-takers occur after a subcategory of tests is completed rather than while the subcategories of tests are still in progress.

columns: Subcategory name; Test name
Rows: CNT(DNA Tested)
Filters: Exclude:1
color: Subcategory name

True
As we can see under each subcategory each test's number of completion is nearly the same. Although under different subcategory, they have the huge difference.
